I am a Software Engineering PhD student in <a href="https://s3d.cmu.edu/">S3D</a> at Carnegie Mellon University with research interests in developer tooling and distributed systems.
<br/><br/>
I have been primarily working with <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly (Wasm)</a> as it is a common, language-independent executable format upon which many new distributed application platforms are being built.
Through targeting this domain, I hope to provide tools for industry adoption backed by meaningful research.
