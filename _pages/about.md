I am a PhD student at Carnegie Mellon University with research interests in developer tooling and distributed systems.

I have been primarily working with WebAssembly (Wasm) as it is a common, language-independent executable format upon which many new distributed application platforms are being built.
Through targeting this domain, I hope to provide tools for industry adoption backed by meaningful research.
